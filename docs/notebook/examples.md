# Examples

Every notebook under `examples/` in the repo demonstrates a specific
Strata capability. Each example is also rendered into the docs site
automatically, click through to read the cell sources and any cached
outputs without cloning the repo.

To run examples locally, point the server's storage root at the
repo's `examples/` directory and start in personal mode:

```bash
STRATA_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE_DIR=$PWD/examples \
STRATA_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=personal \
  uv run strata-notebook
```

Every example then appears on the Strata home page. No copying
required, open the notebook, click Run, edit, watch the cascade.

(If you'd rather keep examples separate from your own work, copy
the directory you want under your existing storage root instead:
`cp -R examples/iris_classification /tmp/strata-notebooks/`.)

## Walkthroughs, start here

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`iris_classification`](../examples/iris_classification.md) | End-to-end ML in seven cells, load → split → train → evaluate → plot. The canonical "multi-cell DAG with caching" demo. |
| [`pandas_basics`](../examples/pandas_basics.md) | Core DataFrame operations and rich display outputs. |
| [`titanic_ml`](../examples/titanic_ml.md) | Feature engineering plus comparison of two classifiers, closer to a real ML workflow. |

## Variant cells

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`model_variants`](../examples/model_variants.md) | Three classifier variants (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) sharing one DAG slot. Switch tabs, re-cascade downstream; the others stay cached. |

## Prompt cells and AI

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`arxiv_classifier`](../examples/arxiv_classifier.md) | AI-powered paper classification, prompt cells + distributed workers in one pipeline. |
| [`review_triage`](../examples/review_triage.md) | Structured-output prompt cells with `@output_schema` + the validate-and-retry loop. |
| [`news_alpha_trader`](../examples/news_alpha_trader.md) | Secret manager + AI pricing lookup + multi-cell DAG. |

## SQL cells

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`sql_orders_report`](../examples/sql_orders_report.md) | Named connections, bind parameters from Python upstream, schema-aware caching. |

## Loop cells

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`loop_hill_climb`](../examples/loop_hill_climb.md) | `# @loop` with carry state and an early-termination predicate. |

## Library cells

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`library_cells`](../examples/library_cells.md) | Cross-cell `def` / `class` sharing via the synthetic-module slicing path. |

## Mounts

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`s3_mount`](../examples/s3_mount.md) | `# @mount` annotation makes an S3 prefix available as a local `pathlib.Path` inside the cell. |

## Markdown rendering

| Notebook | What you'll see |
| --- | --- |
| [`markdown_showcase`](../examples/markdown_showcase.md) | Every markdown rendering path, headings, lists, tables, code blocks, security guards, dynamic `Markdown(...)` output. |
